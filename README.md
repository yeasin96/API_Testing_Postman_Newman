### API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. In other words, an API is the 
messenger that delivers your request to the provider that you're requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you.

### Where is API Testing Performed?
There are three separate layers in a typical app: The presentation (or user interface) layer, The business layer, and The database layer for modeling and manipulating 
data.API testing is performed at the most critical layer: business, in which business logic processing is carried out and all transactions between the user interface 
and database layers happen.

Postman data if you are working as part of a team.
